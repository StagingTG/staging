  8. <b>Digital Downloads. Authorized End Users.</b> In addition to the requirements of the other terms of these Terms, you must meet all of the following requirements to download any Digital Downloads (as defined below): (i) your computer and other Approved Electronic Devices (defined below) must all be physically located in the United States, (ii) any Digital Downloads that you purchase may only be downloaded to your Primary Computer (defined below) or transferred to Secondary Computers (defined below) or Portable Devices (defined below), and (iii) you must first be a registered user of this Site and in full compliance with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Usage Rules.</b> All downloaded music, images, video, artwork, text, software and other copyrightable materials ("Digital Downloads") are sublicensed to End Users and not sold, notwithstanding use of the terms "sell," "purchase," "order," or "M2G' on the Site or these Terms. Your Digital Download sublicense is nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, limited and for use only within the United States.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Standard Usage Rules.</b> You may download music to a single registered personal computer ("Primary Computer"). You may then transfer music files and backup license files to up to two (2) additional personal computers ("Secondary Computers") (but without rights to further transfer or copy from those Secondary Computers). You may play music an unlimited number of times on your Primary Computer and your Secondary Computers. You shall be entitled to (A) burn (only from your Primary Computer) Digital Downloads to CD-R or CD-RW as uncompressed CD audio only (i.e., compressed files may not be burned to CD-R) ten (10) times for your personal, non-commercial use only, to make permanent copies in an uncompressed form conforming to the industry "Red Book" technical specifications to either "write once" blank recordable CD-R compact discs conforming to the industry standard "Orange Book Part II" technical specifications and/or blank "re-writable" CD-RW compact discs, and (B) export Digital Downloads (solely from the Primary Computer) an unlimited number of times to a Portable Device (as defined below). The foregoing are collectively referred to as the "Standard Usage Rules", and together with any more restrictive usage rules that may be imposed by certain labels and licensors, the "Usage Rules". We reserve the right to limit the number of Digital Downloads that you may purchase from a particular label at one time. You may not transfer or distribute Digital Downloads except as stated in the Usage Rules and as limited according to the individual Work's Metadata Information (as defined below). Except as expressly stated as an authorized use under the Usage Rules, no other uses are permitted. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY PROVISION HEREIN, M2G MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT ANY PARTICULAR COMPACT DISC BURNER WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY DIGITAL DOWNLOAD OR THAT ANY COMPACT DISC BURNED WILL FUNCTION IN ALL COMPACT DISC PLAYERS.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Different Licensors May Require More Restricted Usage Rules.</b> Unfortunately, certain labels and licensors of digital downloads may require stricter usage rules than the Standard Usage Rules. When this happens, we will post information on the Site stating changes to permitted uses, if any, of the Digital Downloads pertaining to a particular music song, partial album or album ("the Works"): (i) the number of allowable transfers from your Primary Computer to your Secondary Computers (but without rights to further transfer or copy from those Secondary Computers), (ii) the number of transfers only from the Primary Computer to Portable Devices (as defined below), (iii) the number of Compact Discs that may be "burned" only from the Primary Computer (collectively, "Metadata Information"). End User may only download, transfer, copy and use the Digital Downloads as stated in the particular song, partial album or album's Metadata Information, which is hereby incorporated by reference. No other downloads, transfers, copies or uses of Digital Downloads are permitted. All other rights are reserved.
</p>
<p>
  You may only download, transfer, copy and use the Digital Downloads as stated in the particular Usage Rules for that Digital Download, which Usage Rules are hereby incorporated by reference. No other downloads, transfers, copies or uses of Digital Downloads are permitted. All other rights are reserved. As a condition of purchasing each Digital Download, you represent to M2G that you understand and agree to the limited uses associated with a particular Digital Download's Usage Rules.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Approved Electronic Devices For Digital Downloads.</b> The Digital Music Downloads are sublicensed for play only upon approved electronic devices. "Approved Electronic Devices" are subject to the Usage Rules above and include the following: (i) the Primary Computer and Secondary Computer registered with this Site, and (ii) lightweight devices that receive and store digital music files, and play them back in analog form, but which are incapable of further transferring Digital Downloads ("Portable Devices"). Portable Devices must support the Windows Media Audio ("WMA") format and meet "Class 1000" standards. WMAs are not compatible with any Macintosh Operating Systems.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Prohibited Uses of Digital Downloads.</b> You may not decipher, reverse engineer, decompile, dissassemble, modify or disable any copy protection or use limitation systems associated with any of the Digital Downloads. You may not play and then redigitize any of the Digital Downloads, or upload those Digital Downloads to the Internet. You may not create any "derivative works" by altering any of the Digital Downloads. You may not use the Digital Downloads in conjunction with any other third-party content (e.g, to provide sound for a film). You may not exploit any Digital Download for any commercial purposes (including the sale of bundled Digital Downloads transferred onto Approved Electronic Devices). You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless M2G for your failure to comply with this section.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Conditions to Sublicensing of Digital Downloads to You.</b> Digital Rights Management ("DRM") software will be downloaded onto your Approved Electronic Devices along with your Digital Download music files, and will limit your uses as specified in the Usage Rules. You must first install, and limit any approved uses of the Digital Music Download, using only, Microsoft Corporation's Windows Media Player 9 Series, or higher version or a Media Player that is compatible with secure WMA files. M2G reserves the right to change at any time, without prior notice to you, the software required to download, transfer, copy and use or limit use of any of the Digital Downloads. The speed at which a Digital Download can be transferred to your registered personal computer depends in large part upon the bandwidth of the connection provided to you by your Internet Service Provider. You are responsible for all charges associated with use of your Internet Service. Any estimate of the time required to download music Digital Downloads depends upon your connection bandwidth. M2G DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY MECHANISM IN THE DRM THAT ALLOWS TRANSFER OF LICENSES TO OTHER COMPUTERS OR DEVICES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE. YOU RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THIS LIMITATION AND REPRESENT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT MEANS THAT THE MUSIC FILES MAY NOT BE TRANSFERABLE TO NEW COMPUTERS AND/OR DEVICES IN THE FUTURE.
</p>
<p>
  9. <b>Conditions of Sale and Payment Terms.</b> Each purchase of Digital Downloads by you will be considered to be a separate transaction and each delivery of a Digital Download will constitute a separate sale, whether such delivery is in whole or partial fulfillment of an order. In some cases, we offer to sublicense "Partial Albums," which contain some but not all of the songs offered for a sale on a Compact Disc in an offline record store.
</p>
<p>
  To purchase any goods and/or services on our Site, you must (a) be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the applicable state age of majority, (b) be a natural person (no corporations, partnerships or other legal entities), and (c) be a resident in the 50 states of the United States of America, exclusive of its commonwealths, territories and possessions ("United States").

By submitting that information to us, you hereby agree that you authorize us to charge your card at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of credit card authorization. All sales of products and services are final. All charges from those sales are nonrefundable.
</p>
<p>
  10. <b>Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes. </b>All payments must be made by VISA, MasterCard, or American Express. We currently do not accept cash, checks or any other payment form, although in the future we may change this policy. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT M2G, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. Unless you notify M2G of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If M2G does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by M2G or its agents. You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your purchases, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes. M2G shall automatically charge and withhold the applicable sales tax for orders to be delivered to addresses within California and Massachusetts and any other states or localities that it deems is required. Obligation to pay for Products or Digital Download orders previously accepted by M2G will survive your termination of the Terms.
</p>
<p>
  11. <b>Order Acceptance Policy.</b> Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. M2G reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. M2G further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by M2G upon our delivery of products or services that you have ordered, or upon the completion of the license and delivery of a Digital Download, as indicated by our servers. All orders placed over $1000.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. M2G is a reseller to End Users and does not accept orders from resellers, exporters, wholesalers, any businesses of any kind or other customers who intend to resell.
</p>
<p>
  12. <b>No Responsibility To Sell Mispriced Products Or Services.</b> M2G shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for products and/or services listed at an incorrect price, rebate or refund, or containing any other incorrect information or typographical errors. M2G shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, M2G shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.
</p>
<p>
  13. <b>Modifications to Prices or Billing Terms.</b> M2G RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE ITS PRICES AND BILLING METHODS FOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING ON THE SITE OR BY E-MAIL DELIVERY TO YOU.
</p>
<p>
  14. <b>Price Comparisons, "List Price" and "You Save".</b> Price comparisons may be made throughout the site to indicate the relative savings amounts of our pricing. "LIST PRICE" is the suggested retail price provided to us by our suppliers. We make no representation that a substantial number of these products have been sold or offered for sale at the list price. Actual retail prices in your area may be substantially different. Because we sell our merchandise over the Internet on a national basis, it is not possible to know if our merchandise is sold at list price in any particular location or at any particular time. "YOU SAVE" reflects the difference between our price and the supplier provided list price shown on our sites. Because the list price may be different than the actual retail prices in your area, you may not actually realize a savings of this amount and may want to make an exact comparison for yourself by checking the prices of other Internet or local retailers prior to making a purchase.
</p>
<p>
  15. <b>Service and Support for Goods Sold.</b> All requests for technical service and support should be made directly to the manufacturer in accordance with their terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>
  16. <b>Indemnification</b>. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless M2G and its parents, sister companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, other End Users, distributors, licensors, officers, directors and employees from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party arising out of or related to your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any law, regulation or third-party right.
</p>
<p>
  17. <b>Disclaimer of Warranties.</b> THE SITE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, CONTENT, DIGITAL DOWNLOADS, SOFTWARE, ARTWORK, DATA, AND INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL OF M2G'S PHYSICAL PRODUCTS ARE GUARANTEED AGAINST MATERIAL DEFECTS FOR THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF INVOICE. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, M2G EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER RELATING TO OR REFERENCED BY THE M2G SITE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY OR QUALITY OF DATA AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, SUITABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, LACK OF VIRUSES OR CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION.
</p>
<p>
  18. <b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SITE, THE USE OF ANY PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED ON OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, AND/OR THE USE OF ANY CONTENT AND/OR DIGITAL DOWNLOADS REMAINS WITH YOU.
</p>
<p>
  EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL M2G OR ITS LICENSORS OR ANY OF THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THESE Terms OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, CONTENT AND/OR DIGITAL DOWNLOADS, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE M2G SITE OR RELATED SERVICES, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE M2G SITE WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE EVEN IF M2G HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>
  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE Terms OR POSTED ON THE SITE, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY THAT M2G SHALL HAVE IS LIMITED TO ANY AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID TO M2G BY END USER. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK OF LOSS FOR SHIPPED PRODUCTS. ORDER INFORMATION SUCH AS BILLING OR SHIPPING ADDRESS THAT IS INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE MAY RESULT IN DELAYS THAT SHALL NOT BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF M2G. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITED REMEDIES SET FORTH HEREIN REPRESENT AN INSEPARABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN THE EVENT OF A TOTAL AND FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OF THESE Terms) THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
</p>
<p>
  19. <b>Policy to Terminate Privileges for Copyright Infringement.</b> Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Section 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "Act"), M2G will terminate the account of any customer, or vendor who uses his or her privileges to unlawfully transmit copyrighted material without a license, valid defense or fair use privilege to do so. After proper notification by the copyright holder or its agent to the M2G and later confirmation through court order or an admission by the customer that an account has been an instrument of unlawful infringement or otherwise in compliance with law, M2G will terminate the infringing customer's account. M2G may also in its sole discretion decide to terminate a customer's account privileges prior to that time if it has good belief that infringement has in fact occurred. In addition, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c), M2G has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed infringements and for processing such claims in accordance with the Act. M2G respects the intellectual property of others and we ask you to do the same. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed through the M2G.com website, please contact "Legal Department", via facsimile at (212) 343-3645 or mail at Attn: Legal Department, 73 Spring Street, Suite 601, New York, NY 10012

No delay or failure to take action under these Terms shall constitute any waiver by M2G of any provision of these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it is, to that extent, deemed enforceable to the fullest extent possible (and severable in the event such provision is completely unenforceable) and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
